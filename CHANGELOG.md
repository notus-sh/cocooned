# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## Version 2.0.3 (2023-10-13)

### Fixed

* Rails 7.1 support (#45)

## Version 2.0.2 (2023-05-09)

### Fixed

* Support nested event target in delegated event handlers (#42)

### Changed

* Rewrite dummy app with Rails 6 and webpacker (#40)

## Version 2.0.1 (2023-03-20)

### Fixed

* Webpack compatibility (#39)

## Version 2.0.0 (2023-03-07)

* Drop support for Rails < 6.0

### Breaking changes

#### Features dropped without any replacements

* Use of a function as `data-association-insertion-node` on add triggers support have been dropped (#18)  
  As HTML dataset are `DOMStringMap`, they only support strings as values. The only way to use a function to loop up for insertion node on an add trigger was to use jQuery (ex: `$(addTrigger).data('association-insertion-node', (add) => {})`).
* `data-remove-timeout` on remove triggers (#18)  
  Items are now removed at the end of their hiding animation.

#### Events listener now use `CustomEvent`s (#17)

Cocooned events have been rewritten around `CustomEvent`s and standard `addEventListener` / `dispatchEvent`.
You should either rewrite your event binding with `addEventListener` or change your jQuery ones as follow:

```diff
- $(element).on('cocooned:event', (e, node, cocooned) => {
+ $(element).on('cocooned:event', e => {
+   { node, cocooned } = e.detail // Use nodes in 'cocooned:before-reindex' / 'cocooned:after-reindex' events
  })
```

### Deprecations

These features are now deprecated and emit a warning message:

* `:insertion_traversal` option on `cocooned_add_item_link` (#18)
  Use a more specific selector as `data-association-insertion-node` (set through `:insertion_node`) instead.
* Importing `@notus.sh/cocooned/cocooned` in your JavaScript files (#22)  
  Import Cocooned from either `@notus.sh/cocooned`, `@notus.sh/cocooned/jquery` or `@notus.sh/cocooned/src/cocooned/cocooned` instead.

These features are now deprecated but don't emit any warning message (sorry):

* Containers identified only by the `data-cocooned-options` attribute (#26)  
  Use the `cocooned_container` helper in your forms.
* Containers identified only by the `.cocooned-item` class (#26)  
  Use the `cocooned_item` helper in your forms.

These features were already deprecated but now emit a warning message:

* `link_to_add_association` (replaced by `cocooned_add_item_link`)
* `link_to_remove_association` (replaced by `cocooned_remove_item_link`)
* The `cocoon` I18n namespace (replaced by `cocooned`)
* `:render_option` option on `cocooned_add_item_link` / `link_to_add_association`  
  Use `:form_options` and/or `:locals` instead.

These features were already deprecated but (still) don't emit any warning message (sorry):

* Events in `cocoon` namespace (replaced by `cocooned`)
* Triggers only identified by Cocoon classes (`.add_fields`, `.remove_fields`)
* Cocoon auto-start logic (non-identified containers)

All deprecated features will be removed in the next major release.
